## Dental hygiene: How to prevent expensive dental treatment

###### Good dental hygiene is the most important prerequisite for keeping beautiful and healthy teeth for as long as possible. This includes not only daily tooth brushing and the use of dental floss, but also regular tooth cleaning by the dentist. However, the costs for professional dental cleaning are not covered by the basic health insurance. It is not only for this reason that we recommend taking out supplementary dental insurance.

## Why is regular dental hygiene worthwhile?

###### You can do a lot yourself for healthy teeth and gums. Brushing your teeth at least twice a day should be part of your routine. Clean interdental spaces with dental floss, an interdental brush or a special oral shower. In addition, it is recommended that you have your teeth professionally cleaned by a dentist once a year.

###### The tooth cleaning removes tartar as well as any deposits and discolorations that you can't cope with using a toothbrush. The subsequent polishing makes your teeth appear natural white and pleasantly smooth. The dentist will also show you how to improve your dental hygiene at home. When cleaning your teeth, the dentist will also check your teeth and gums. This allows caries, periodontosis and any problems with the neck of the tooth to be detected early and treated quickly. This prevents major problems and high treatment costs.

## Coverage of costs by supplementary dental insurance

###### The costs for dental hygiene are not covered by the compulsory basic insurance. On average, you pay 160 Swiss francs for a thorough dental cleaning including tartar removal with ultrasound. If you do not want to pay these costs out of your own pocket, it is worth taking out supplementary dental insurance.

###### The dental insurance not only covers the costs for regular dental hygiene, but also pays a portion for dental treatment, malpositioning corrections and orthodontic measures. It is advisable to take out the treatment as early as childhood. In this way, high costs for braces or the extraction of whiteness teeth can be avoided. An early conclusion is also worthwhile, as most health insurance companies require a medical certificate from the 3rd or 5th birthday.

## Compare supplementary dental insurances and save money

###### The benefits and conditions of the individual supplementary dental insurances vary enormously. Most health insurers cover 50 to 75 percent of dental costs, but limit their annual contributions to a certain maximum amount. Some pay up to 2,000 CHF a year, others up to 5,000 CHF. However, tooth corrections and implants can cost many times as much. Some health insurance companies also require a so-called waiting period of three or six months. No treatment costs are covered during this period.

###### Before you take out dental insurance, you should compare the offers and services of the various health insurance companies in detail. We will be happy to help you and advise you free of charge and without obligation. In this way, you can easily find an insurer who also contributes to the costs of dental hygiene.
