## The basic insurance of Arcosana

###### The benefits of the basic insurance are regulated by law. In the Standard model (free choice of doctor), you can freely choose which doctor you visit in the event of illness. If you would like to save premiums, you can opt for an alternative insurance model. The family doctor model stipulates that you should first contact your family doctor in the event of illness. If there is a need for further treatment, the family doctor will refer you to a specialist or to a hospital. If you opt for the group practice (HMO) model, your first point of contact will be a group practice or a physician's network. In the Telmed model, you will first be advised by the medical experts of the Medgate hotline by telephone and will receive a referral if necessary. Gynaecologists and ophthalmologists can also be contacted directly without a referral.

## Premium discounts in basic insurance

###### If you choose an alternative insurance model, Arcosana Health Insurance will grant you premium discounts. Discounts of up to 16 percent are possible. You can also reduce your premiums if you opt for a higher deductible. The maximum franchise for adults is 2,500 CHF per year.

## Extended insurance cover through supplementary insurance

###### The benefits of the basic insurance can be supplemented by a voluntary supplementary insurance. With the myFlex supplementary insurance, Arcosana Health Insurance offers flexible additional cover for outpatient treatment, alternative medicine and hospitalisation.

###### The myFlex outpatient insurance covers worldwide emergency treatment and repatriation, makes contributions to laser eye treatments and pays for dental corrections for children.

###### The alternative insurance myFlex is aimed at all those who wish to have extended coverage for alternative medicine. The supplementary insurance reimburses treatment costs of up to 10,000 Swiss francs; there is no deductible.

###### With myFlex hospital insurance, you enjoy a free choice of hospital and can choose before you go to hospital whether you want to stay in a general ward, semi-private or private ward.

###### The supplementary insurances are available in the Economy, Balance and Premium levels, which differ in the amount of the premiums and the maximum amount of reimbursement.

## Family discount in supplementary insurance

###### With myFlex supplementary insurance, children benefit from up to 100 percent family discounts on economy fares. Discounts of 25 to 75 percent are possible in the Balance and Premium rates. You can also save money if you combine supplementary hospital insurance with daily hospital benefit insurance or restrict your choice of hospital to a hospital list.

## Optional dental insurance

###### The dental insurance of the Arcosana health insurance company covers costs that are not covered by the compulsory health insurance. This includes services in the areas of dental hygiene, fillings, dental prostheses, tooth position corrections and check-ups. Depending on the tariff selected, the amount of the reimbursement is between 50 and 75 percent of the treatment costs, with the health insurance paying a maximum of 5,000 Swiss francs per calendar year.
