## Five models for basic insurance

###### Atupri Health Insurance wants to offer its members the most individual insurance cover possible. Five different models are therefore available for the basic insurance:

### The Standard model (free choice of doctor): You choose your doctor yourself.

### The family doctor model CareMed: You visit your family doctor in the event of illness.

### The group practice (HMO) model: You first contact a medical centre.

### The TelFirst telemedicine model.

### The FlexCare model combines the services of TelFirst and HMO model: In the event of illness, you decide flexibly whether you first call the Medgate telephone helpline or visit a Medgate Health Center.

###### The FlexCare model is only available in the cities and conurbations of Zurich, Bern and Lucerne and in the canton of Baselland.

## Supplementary insurance tailored to your needs

###### A supplementary insurance closes insurance gaps, for example in the areas of alternative medicine and prevention. Mivita supplementary insurance adapts to your personal circumstances. The Reala model is slightly cheaper, but offers lower reimbursement sums. For the Extensa model, you pay slightly higher premiums for higher reimbursement amounts. The supplementary insurances cover treatments on trips abroad, alternative medicine and co-payments for glasses and medical aids. Depending on your age and gender, you can also take out specific benefits, such as contraceptives or baby massages.

## Denta Dental Care Insurance

###### Denta dental insurance is available in two levels. Stage I covers 60 percent of the costs of general dental treatment, up to a maximum of CHF 500 per calendar year. Level 2 also covers 60 percent of the costs, but pays a maximum of CHF 1,000 per calendar year.

## Supplementary hospital insurance from Atupri

###### If you have taken out the Mivita supplementary insurance, you can ensure more comfort in hospital with the Comforta hospital insurance. You can choose between the semi-private, private and Comforta Opti insurance models. With Opti, you only decide what comfort you want shortly before you go to hospital. You can also take out hospital insurance without additional Atupri insurance.

## Premium discounts and family discounts

###### For the alternative basic insurance models CareMed, HMO, TelFirst and FlexCare, the health insurance company grants premium discounts. Depending on the model, discounts of up to 17 percent are possible. Premium discounts are also available if you opt for a higher deductible rate. The maximum franchise for adults is CHF 2,500, for children CHF 600.

###### If one parent has taken out Mivita supplementary insurance, there is a family discount for children and young adults up to the age of 25. For children up to 25 years of age, the Denta dental insurance is also included in the supplementary insurance.
