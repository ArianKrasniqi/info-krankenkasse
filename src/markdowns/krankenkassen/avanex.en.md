## Various basic insurance models

###### Like all Swiss health insurance companies, Avanex also offers compulsory basic insurance in accordance with the KVG. The scope of benefits is prescribed by law, but the insurance companies have a certain degree of freedom in drawing up contracts. In addition to the Standard basic model (free choice of physician), there are three alternative insurance models to choose from. They limit the choice of the first contact person, but reward this with lower premiums.

###### In the BeneFit PLUS Family Doctor/HMO model, your first contact is your family doctor or a group practice (HMO). BeneFit PLUS Telmed and PREMED-24 are Telmed models. In the event of illness, you should first contact a telemedical counselling centre. With PREMED-24 you are then free to consult a doctor of your choice.

## Lower premiums due to higher deductible rate

###### Another way to reduce your insurance premiums is to choose a higher annual deductible. The higher the deductible, the higher the discount. The maximum annual deductible for adults is CHF 2,500, for children CHF 600.

## More benefits through voluntary supplementary insurance 

###### Avanex health insurance has a wide range of supplementary insurances in its portfolio. The Top outpatient supplementary insurance pays, for example, extended subsidies for visual aids, medication, psychotherapy, treatment abroad and much more. Sana reimburses treatments in the field of alternative medicine and measures for prevention and health promotion. Completa combines the benefits of these two insurances into a complete package.

###### With the World tariff, you can insure yourself against medical emergencies abroad. With Primeo, you enjoy free choice of doctor and more comfort during your stay in hospital. Finally, Omnia is an insurance package with basic additional benefits. If you would like a higher level of insurance, you can take out this every five years without a further health check.

## DENTAPlus dental insurance

###### With DENTAPlus, Avanex also offers supplementary dental insurance. The costs for dental treatment, dental hygiene and dental malposition corrections are reimbursed at a maximum of 75 percent, up to 3,000 Swiss francs per calendar year.

## More comfort and freedom of choice in the hospital

###### Hospital insurance Hospital is aimed at all those who want more comfort when staying in hospital. The four service levels differ according to the type of accommodation:

### Eco: general ward

### Semi-private: semi-private department

### Private: private department

### Flex: flexible choice of accommodation before each hospital stay

###### Each benefit level of the supplementary hospital insurance grants free choice of hospital throughout Switzerland. In the semi-private, private and flex benefit levels, you are also free to choose the doctor treating you. The Hospital Extra daily benefits insurance supplements the offer.

## Family discount in the supplementary insurances

###### If you take out supplementary health insurance for several people in your household, Avanex will reward you with a discount. For two insured persons this discount is 5 percent, for three policyholders 10 percent.
