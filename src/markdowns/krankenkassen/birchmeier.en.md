## Two basic insurance models

###### Birchmeier health insurance offers two basic insurance models: In the Standard model (free choice of doctor), you receive the legally prescribed benefits of compulsory health insurance. In this plan, you can choose freely whether you first visit your family doctor, a group practice (HMO) or a specialist directly in the event of illness.

###### Alternatively, you can opt for the family doctor model. In the event of illness, you should first contact your family doctor, who you can select from a list of health insurers. Birchmeier grants you a 12 percent premium discount for the alternative model.

## Lower premiums due to higher deductible rate

###### Health insurance offers lucrative discounts for the choice of a higher deductible rate. An annual deductible of 2,500 Swiss francs reduces your premium by up to 38.2 percent. A maximum annual deductible of 600 Swiss francs is available for children.

## The Birchmeier supplementary insurances

###### Voluntary supplementary insurance supplements the benefits provided by compulsory health insurance. Birchmeier health insurance distinguishes itself by a special offer for non-smokers: The sanvita supplementary insurance provides comprehensive reimbursement for outpatient treatment. Smoking-related illnesses are excluded. Non-smokers benefit from a premium discount of up to 35 percent in this tariff.

###### Smokers can opt for the activa supplementary health insurance. Both the sanvita model and the activa model are available in two benefit levels, Plus 1 and Plus 2. The models offer contributions to treatments in the field of alternative medicine, fitness subscriptions, visual aids, household aids and corrections of malocclusions and dental treatments for children and adolescents.

## The dental supplementary insurance denta

###### With the denta dental insurance, adults can protect themselves from high dental treatment costs. The supplementary insurance is offered in three benefit levels and covers between 50 and 75 percent of treatment costs, up to a maximum of 3,000 Swiss francs per calendar year.

## Birchmeier Supplementary Hospital Insurance

###### A hospital insurance policy gives you more freedom of choice and comfort during inpatient stays. With Birchmeier supplementary hospital insurance, you are free to choose the hospital and the doctor treating you throughout Switzerland. Depending on the tariff, you will be accommodated in the general ward, semi-privately in a two-bed room or privately in a single room. In the Switch model, you can flexibly select the desired comfort before you go to hospital. The insurance also covers bathing and recreational cures.

## Family discount in the supplementary insurances

###### If at least one parent has taken out supplementary insurance with Birchmeier, children up to the age of 18 receive a family discount of 20 percent under a comparable insurance policy. The general hospital model is excluded.
