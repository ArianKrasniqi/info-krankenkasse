###### The compulsory health insurance is the basic insurance protection of the health insurance fund, its benefits are prescribed by law. In the Standard model (free choice of doctor), you are free to choose whether to consult your family doctor, a group practice (HMO) or a specialist first in the event of illness. In addition, the health insurance company offers two alternative models with which you can save premiums:

### The EGK-Care model is a so-called ManagedCare family doctor model. In the event of illness, you first contact your family doctor, who then determines the further treatment.
