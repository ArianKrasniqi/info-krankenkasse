## Groupe Mutuel basic insurance

###### In the Groupe Mutuel basic insurance you have the choice between different models. The traditional basic insurance covers costs in the event of illness, pregnancy, accident and for compulsory medicines. You have a free choice of doctor. The amount of the premium depends on the deductible.

###### By choosing an alternative insurance model, you can reduce the insurance premium. The alternative insurance model Primacare is a family doctor model. In the event of illness or accident, you should first consult your family doctor. This can also be the family doctor in a group practice (HMO). If necessary, your family doctor will refer you to a specialist. With the alternative Doctors' Network insurance model, you select your family doctor from a list of Groupe Mutuel partner doctors. A telemedicine model is also available. If you opt for the SanaTel Telmed model, call the Medi24 telemedicine advice centre first in the event of illness. The advice centre will refer you to a doctor or hospital.
