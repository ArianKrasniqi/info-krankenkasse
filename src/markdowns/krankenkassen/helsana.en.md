## Helsana basic insurance

###### Helsana Krankenkasse offers both basic and supplementary health insurance as well as dental insurance. You can take out Helsana basic insurance in the standard version or as an alternative insurance model (AVM).

###### The Basic package is the traditional basic insurance model. The insurance covers all statutory medical benefits in the event of illness, pregnancy and accident. As a policyholder, you are free to choose the type of treatment you want, i.e. you can decide whether you want to have your family doctor or a specialist treat you directly. The amount of the monthly premium depends on the chosen deductible rate.

###### The alternative general practitioner model BeneFit PLUS requires that you first consult your general practitioner in the event of an illness or make use of your general practitioner in a group practice (HMO). There you will receive the same benefits as with the standard basic insurance. If necessary, your family doctor will refer you to a specialist. With this model, you can save at least 12 percent on premiums.

###### You can save around 15 percent on your premium if you choose the Telmed model. The health insurance tariff called BeneFit PLUS Telemedicine requires that you call the free hotline of the Medgate medical advice centre in the event of illness. If further medical clarification or treatment is required, the advice centre will refer you to a doctor or hospital.

## Helsana supplementary insurance

###### With a voluntary supplementary insurance, you insure benefits that are not covered or only insufficiently covered by the basic insurance. Helsana offers a wide range of supplementary insurance including dental insurance:
