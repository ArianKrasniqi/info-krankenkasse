## Models of obligatory basic insurance

###### The benefits of the compulsory basic insurance are prescribed by law. If you want to save premiums, you can opt for an alternative insurance model. This restricts the selection of the first contact person in the event of illness, and the health insurance company grants discounts for this.

###### Kolping health insurance offers a choice of six basic insurance models:

### Classic (free choice of doctor): You are free to choose your doctor throughout Switzerland.

### Casamed family doctor: Your first point of contact is your family doctor.

### Casamed HMO: You first go to a group practice.

### Callmed 24: In the event of illness, first call a telemedical advice centre.

### Flexhelp24: You can either contact an HMO practice or call a telemedical advice centre.

### Casamed Pharm: You first contact a Sympany partner pharmacy.

###### You can also secure premium discounts if you agree a higher franchise. The maximum franchise is CHF 2,500 per calendar year for adults and CHF 600 for children.

## Outpatient supplementary insurance

###### An outpatient supplementary insurance complements the basic insurance benefits. The supplementary insurance Plus, for example, pays increased contributions to transport and rescue measures in the event of emergencies abroad, to visual aids, medicines not covered by the health insurance, psychotherapeutic treatments, alternative medicine and preventive health care. With the Premium supplementary insurance, the reimbursement contributions are even higher, and you pay more premiums for this. Both supplementary insurances pay a premium for memberships in gyms or sports clubs.

## Family discount in supplementary insurance

###### Families who insure their children with the Kolping Health Insurance can secure premium discounts. For children under the age of 18, there is a 30 percent family discount if at least one parent is a member of the health insurance.

## Additional dental insurance

###### Dental Insurance Dental insures dental treatment in Switzerland and neighbouring countries. It reimburses up to CHF 5,000 per calendar year for dental treatment and laboratory work and up to CHF 100 per year for dental check-ups, dental cleaning and X-rays. Dental insurance is free of charge for children under the age of 3.

## Supplementary hospital insurance for more comfort in hospital

###### Hospital insurance supplements the range of basic insurance benefits with free choice of hospital and doctor throughout Switzerland. Depending on the model, you can also decide whether you want to stay in a semi-private ward in a two-bed room or in a private ward in a single room.

###### Kolping health insurance offers the following hospital insurances:

### Hospita General

### Hospita Flex

### Hospita Flex with semi-private option or private option

### Hospita Semi Private

### Hospita Private

### Hospita Global

###### In the Flex tariffs, you decide flexibly before each hospital stay what comfort you want.
