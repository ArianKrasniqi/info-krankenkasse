## The different models of basic insurance

###### Like Groupe Mutuel, Philos Krankenkasse also offers various models of compulsory basic health insurance. In the traditional Standard model (free choice of doctor), you can contact the doctor of your choice or a group practice (HMO) directly in the event of health problems. In the PrimaCare model (general practitioner), your first point of contact is your general practitioner. In the Sanatel model (Telmed), you first call a telemedical counselling centre in the event of illness. The PrimaTel model combines the advantages of the Telmed model with the care provided by your family doctor. In the Doctors' Network model, you select your family doctor from a network of doctors. Depending on your canton of residence, you can take out insurance under the BasicPlus, Geneva Care Network or Optimed tariff.

## Premium discounts through alternative models such as PrimaCare (family doctor)

###### The choice of an alternative insurance model rewards the health insurance company with lower premiums. In the PrimaCare tariff (family doctor), for example, you save 11 percent compared to the standard model. In the Telmed models there are even discounts of up to 15 percent. Premium discounts are also secured by a higher franchise. Adults can agree a franchise of up to 2,500 Swiss francs per year; the maximum annual franchise for children is 600 francs.

## Global, Mundo, Alterna: Individual insurance cover with a voluntary supplementary insurance policy

###### A voluntary supplementary insurance supplements the scope of benefits of the basic insurance. With Philos Krankenkasse, you can choose a supplementary insurance that meets your personal needs. The supplementary health insurance, for example, reimburses higher premiums and grants premium discounts if you do not make use of any benefits. The Global supplementary insurance combines high subsidies for alternative medicine, medical aids and health care with hospital insurance.

###### The supplementary insurance Alterna covers 20 treatment methods of alternative medicine, provided that they are carried out by a doctor. The Mundo tariff protects you against high treatment and patient transport costs abroad. Dentair Plus dental insurance covers up to 75% of the cost of dental treatment, up to a maximum of CHF 15,000 per calendar year, depending on the benefit level.

## More comfort in hospital

###### The additional hospital insurance of the Philos health insurance company is also available in different variants. Free choice of hospital and doctor in every model throughout Switzerland. Accommodation depends on the tariff in the general ward, semi-private or private. If you opt for the H-Bonus model, you can flexibly determine the desired comfort before each hospital stay. The Hopital Senior tariff is aimed specifically at policyholders aged 55 and over.

## Family discount in supplementary insurance

###### The health insurance company will reward you if you take out a Philos supplementary insurance policy for your children as well. In the Global Classic model, you benefit from a lucrative family discount.
