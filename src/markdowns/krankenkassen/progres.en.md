## Four basic insurance models

###### Every resident of Switzerland must take out compulsory health insurance. The benefits are prescribed by law and are the same for all health insurances. However, the level of premiums varies enormously in some cases. If you want to save premiums, you can choose an alternative insurance model. Progres Health Insurance offers a total of four models of compulsory basic health insurance:

### Basis (free choice of doctor): In the event of illness, you contact a doctor you trust 

### BeneFit PLUS (family doctor/ HMO): With Benefit Plus (general practitioner), you first visit your general practitioner or a group practice (HMO) in the event of illness.

### BeneFit PLUS (Telmed): Your first point of contact is a telemedical advice hotline.

### PREMED-24: Combines the Telmed model with free choice of doctor.

## Premium discounts due to higher deductible rate

###### By choosing an alternative insurance model such as Benefit Plus (family doctor), you receive premium discounts of up to 15 percent. You can also secure discounts by increasing your franchise. The regular annual franchise for adults is 300 Swiss francs; you can optionally pay up to 2,500 francs.

## More comprehensive range of benefits through voluntary supplementary insurance

###### If you wish to make higher contributions to aids, health care or alternative medicine, you can take out voluntary supplementary insurance. Progres supplementary insurance Top pays higher contributions to a number of outpatient treatments, Sana pays higher co-payments for alternative medicine and prevention, participates in fitness subscriptions, for example. Completa combines the services of Top and Sana and in some cases offers even higher subsidies. Primeo guarantees free choice of doctor and more comfort for outpatient treatment in the hospital. Omnia is an all-round cover with the most important additional services as well as the guarantee to be able to upgrade the insurance cover without a further health check.

###### The DENTAplus supplementary insurance (dental insurance) covers dental checks, root canal treatments, dental fillings, dental prostheses and orthodontic treatments for children and adults at home and abroad. For dental treatment, a maximum of 75% of the costs up to 3000 francs per calendar year will be reimbursed.

###### With Advocare PLUS and Advocare EXTRA, Progres health insurance also offers affordable legal expenses insurance for private and traffic law as well as Internet law.

## More comfort in hospital with hospital insurance

In the Hospital Flex tariff, you choose which ward you would like to be accommodated in before each hospital stay.
