## Three basic insurance models

###### Rhenusana Health Insurance offers three models of compulsory health insurance: In the Standard model (free choice of doctor) you can go to a doctor you trust in the event of illness, either a family doctor, a doctor in a group practice (HMO) or a specialist. The discount model family doctor system provides that in case of illness you first contact your family doctor. In the sanmed24 (Telmed) discount model, you first call a telemedical advice hotline, which decides on the further course of treatment and refers you to your family doctor or hospital if necessary.

## Premium discounts in basic insurance

###### You can reduce your basic insurance premiums with Rhenusana Health Insurance in various ways:

### You choose an alternative insurance model.

### You pay your premiums annually or semi-annually. There are discounts between 0.5 and 1 percent.

### You choose a higher deductible rate. The higher the deductible rate, the lower the premiums.

### Family discount: From the third insured child onwards, households pay only 10 percent of the adult premium.

## Attractive additional benefits with a voluntary supplementary insurance plan

###### With an additional insurance of the Rhenusana health insurance you secure more benefits in case of illness. You benefit, for example, from higher co-payments for alternative medicine, prevention, dental treatment and more comfort in hospital.

###### Rhenusana offers the following supplementary insurances:

### rhenuPLUS is an outpatient supplementary insurance with very high co-payments by comparison. The health insurance pays up to CHF 550 per year for visual aids, up to CHF 10,000 for alternative medicine and up to CHF 2,000 for health promotion such as fitness subscriptions. The supplementary insurance also covers transport and rescue costs and orthodontic treatment (up to the age of 20).

### rhenuDENTA is a dental insurance with three benefit levels, which covers the costs of dental treatment, prophylaxis and orthodontics in Switzerland and abroad. Policyholders are reimbursed a maximum of 90 percent of treatment costs, up to 2,000 Swiss francs per calendar year.

### rhenuHOSPITAL is a flexible supplementary hospital insurance policy. For inpatient stays, you enjoy free choice of doctor and hospital throughout Switzerland. Before you go to hospital, you decide whether you want to stay in the general ward, semi-private or private.

### rhenuSWISS grants you free hospital choice throughout Switzerland and the Principality of Liechtenstein in the event of illness, accident or maternity. Accommodation is in the general ward.
