## Models of basic insurance

###### The benefits of compulsory basic health insurance are specified by the Health Insurance Act (KVG) and are the same for all health insurance funds. However, the premiums differ depending on the health insurance and canton.

###### In addition to the Standard model (free choice of doctor), Sana24 offers five alternative insurance models. In the traditional model, you can choose your doctor freely in the event of illness; the other models restrict the choice of the first contact person. In the Managed Care (family doctor) model, you first contact your family doctor or a group practice (HMO). In the Med Direct model (general practitioner), your general practitioner is the first point of contact.

###### There are also three Telmed models: In the TelDoc (Telmed) model, the medical advice hotline prescribes a binding treatment plan. In the Med Call (Telmed) model, you decide for yourself whether you follow the treatment plan or not. The TelCare (Telmed) tariff is only available in certain cantons.

## Premium discounts in basic insurance

###### When you choose an alternative insurance model, you receive premium discounts of up to 17 percent. You can also reduce your premiums by opting for a higher deductible. The regular franchise for adults is CHF 300 per year, but can be increased up to CHF 2,500.
