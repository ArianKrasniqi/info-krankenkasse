## The Sanagate basic insurance

###### The basic insurance covers statutory benefits in the event of illness, accident and maternity. In the standard model, you have a free choice of doctor. The premium depends on where you live and your income. If you increase the franchise, you can save up to 43 percent on the premium.

###### There are also cheaper premiums if you opt for an alternative insurance model. Sanagate's family doctor insurance offers a 7 percent premium discount. You select a family doctor from a list of doctors and visit him first in the event of illness. Ophthalmologists, gynaecologists and dentists have a free choice of doctor.

###### With the SanaCall telemedicine model, you first contact the Medgate telemedicine centre if you are ill. If necessary, the staff will refer you to a doctor or hospital. If you opt for the Telemed model, you will receive a premium discount of up to 12 percent.

## Sanagate supplementary insurance: Close insurance gaps

###### With a voluntary supplementary insurance you close gaps in your insurance. Sanagate offers the additional out-patient insurance in two stages:

### Minima is aimed at young, budget-conscious policyholders. The supplementary insurance covers medicines not covered by health insurance, transport and rescue costs as well as ultrasound examinations during pregnancy. It contributes to the cost of medical aids and provides worldwide cover for medical emergencies. A holiday and travel insurance as well as a patient and foreign law insurance are also integrated.

### Optima supplementary insurance supplements the range of services with a cost sharing for glasses, contact lenses and laser treatment, covers dental treatment and tooth position corrections for children and contributes to the costs of domestic help.

## Hospital insurance in two stages

###### Sanagate's supplementary hospital insurance is also offered in two insurance levels. With the Minima option, you have a free choice of doctor and hospital throughout Switzerland, can choose between accommodation in a general, semi-private or private ward and receive contributions for bathing and recreational cures. Optima hospital insurance is aimed primarily at families. If an insured child has to go to hospital, the health insurance pays for the accommodation costs of an accompanying person.

## The Sanagate alternative insurance plan

###### The alternative insurance covers up to 80 percent of the costs of treatment in the field of alternative medicine. Health insurance pays a maximum of 1,500 Swiss francs per year. You receive subsidies for treatment methods such as homeopathy, osteopathy, Chinese medicine, Ayurveda and acupuncture.

## Additional dental insurance

###### Sanagate's dental insurance covers outpatient dental treatments, dentures and tooth position corrections. You can choose from six service levels. The maximum cost coverage is 75 percent, a maximum of 5,000 Swiss francs per year, with a franchise of 500 francs per calendar year. A waiting period of six to twelve months applies to dental insurance.
