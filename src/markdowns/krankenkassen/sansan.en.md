## The compulsory basic insurance of Sansan

###### Sansan Health Insurance offers the same insurance models as Helsana. The compulsory basic insurance can be taken out as a standard model (free choice of doctor) or as one of three alternative insurance models:

### BeneFit PLUS General practitioner/ HMO: In the event of illness, you should first contact your family doctor or a group practice (HMO).

### BeneFit PLUS Telmed: In the event of illness, you call a free telemedical advice centre and receive an individual treatment plan.

### PREMED-24: Before you visit the doctor, contact the telemedical counselling centre and receive non-binding advice. If necessary, you can then consult a doctor of your choice.

## Save premiums through alternative insurance models and higher franchises

###### For the choice of an alternative insurance model you will receive discounts between 8 and 15 percent. To reduce your insurance premium, you can also voluntarily pay a higher deductible. The maximum annual deductible for adults is CHF 2,500, for children CHF 600.

## Outpatient supplementary insurance from Sansan

###### Supplementary insurance extends the benefits of compulsory health insurance. Sansan offers a wide range of supplementary insurances for different needs:

### Top is a basic supplementary insurance for outpatient services such as glasses, medication, psychotherapy, protection abroad and more.

### Sana offers comprehensive benefits for alternative medicine, prevention and health promotion.

### Completa combines the benefits of Top and Sana and in some cases offers higher reimbursements. 

### World is a travel insurance for medical emergencies abroad. 

### Primeo offers free choice of doctor and more comfort during your stay in hospital. 

### Omnia offers the most important additional services and ensures that you are included in a higher insurance policy without further health checks.

## Four benefit levels of hospital insurance

###### In addition to outpatient supplementary insurance, you can also take out supplementary hospital insurance with Sansan. Hospital insurance is available in four benefit levels:

### Eco: free choice of hospital and accommodation in a shared room in the general ward

### Semi-private: free choice of hospital and doctor as well as accommodation in a two-bed room in the semi-private ward

### Private: free choice of hospital and doctor as well as accommodation in a single room in the private ward

### Flex: flexible choice of department before each hospital stay with free hospital choice

###### In addition, you can opt for the Hospital Extra daily benefits insurance.

## Dental insurance DENTAPlus

###### DENTAPlus insures you against high dental costs. The insurance covers dental treatment, tooth malposition corrections and dental hygiene. The reimbursement depends on the level of service. You will be reimbursed a maximum of 75 percent of the treatment costs, up to a sum of CHF 3,000 per calendar year.

## Families benefit from discounts

###### If you insure several family members at the same time in an additional insurance of the Sansan health insurance, you receive a lucrative family discount. In supplementary health insurance, this is 5 percent for two insured persons from the same household, and even 10 percent for three or more insured persons.
