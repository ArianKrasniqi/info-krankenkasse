## The basic insurance of SLKK

###### SLKK offers health insurance based on the modular principle. The obligatory basic insurance forms the foundation. In addition to the traditional Standard model (free choice of doctor), the alternative models TelCare (Telmed) and HomeCare (family doctor) are also available. In the traditional model, you choose which doctor you visit in the event of illness. You can also make use of the doctors in a group practice (HMO). In the TelCare model you first call a medical advice hotline, in the HomeCare model (general practitioner) your general practitioner is the first point of contact.

## Premium discounts in basic insurance

###### The health insurance company gives you several possibilities to reduce your premiums. If you pay your health insurance premiums in advance, you will receive discounts of between 0.5 and 1 percent. Premium discounts are also available for choosing the TelCare model or the HomeCare model (family doctor). If you want to save money, you can also have your franchise increased. The maximum possible franchise for adults is 2,500 Swiss francs per year, for children 600 Swiss francs.

## Supplementary insurance: The SLKK offer

###### The second component of your personal health insurance is a voluntary supplementary insurance.

###### The Medico-Plus supplementary insurance supplements the basic outpatient insurance benefits and is available in four different versions:

### Standard offers higher and extended reimbursements for numerous treatments and aids.

### Alternatively, it offers higher co-payments to alternative medicine.

### Complet combines the services of Standard and Alternative.

### Jeunesse is a special supplementary insurance for children and adolescents up to the age of 18.

###### The additional insurance QualiCare.basis combines contributions to alternative medicine, health care, visual aids and other aids with reimbursements for gynaecological check-ups, jaw and tooth malposition corrections and much more. The QualiCare.comfort package adds further service areas such as contraceptives, breastfeeding money and cosmetic operations.

## SLKK supplementary hospital insurance

###### With SLKK hospital insurance, you decide for yourself which hospital and doctor you would like to be treated in. Depending on the model, you can also increase your comfort during your stay in hospital. You can choose between the General F1, Semi-Private F2, Private F3 and Worldwide Private F4 models. In the SuperFlex model, you decide spontaneously before each stay in hospital which ward you would like to be accommodated in.

## SLKK dental insurance

###### As an additional insurance the health insurance offers a dental insurance. There are five different benefit levels to choose from, covering between 50 and 75 percent of dental treatment costs, up to a maximum of 3,000 Swiss francs per calendar year.

## Family discount for SLKK supplementary insurance

###### If you pay your premiums for the supplementary insurance half-yearly or annually in advance, you benefit from discounts just as you do for the basic insurance. Family discounts are granted by the health insurance from the third insured child onwards.
