## Three basic insurance models

###### Sodalis Krankenkasse offers three models of compulsory basic health insurance:

### In the basic model Medica (free choice of doctor), you can choose in the event of illness whether you go to your family doctor, a group practice (HMO) or go directly to a specialist.

### In the MediCasa model (general practitioner), your general practitioner is the first point of contact in the event of illness.

### If you conclude a telemedical model (Telmed), first call a consultation hotline in the event of illness.

## Your chance for premium discounts

###### If you choose one of the alternative insurance models, MediCasa (family doctor) or the telemedical model (Telmed), Sodalis Health Insurance will grant you premium discounts. You will also receive premium discounts if you increase the franchise. In all three models, a maximum annual franchise of 2,500 Swiss francs applies to adults and young people between the ages of 19 and 25. There is no franchise for children under the age of 19.

## More benefits with voluntary supplementary insurance

###### A voluntary supplementary insurance covers higher contributions to various health services, such as prevention and alternative medicine, and closes gaps in basic insurance coverage. Sodalis Krankenkasse offers the Sana and SanaPlus models as outpatient supplementary insurance. For example, Sana reimburses 70 percent of treatment costs in the field of alternative medicine, up to an annual amount of 500 Swiss francs. SanaPlus even takes over up to 1,000 Swiss francs a year. For visual aids you will receive annual contributions of a maximum of 150 and 400 Swiss francs respectively. Depending on the model, the supplementary insurance covers prevention services at 50 or 100 percent, up to 500 or 1,000 Swiss francs per year.

## Dental insurance for healthy teeth

###### Denta dental insurance is available in three benefit levels. For dental treatment, laboratory services, prophylaxis and check-ups, the supplementary insurance covers 75 percent of the costs, up to 3,000 Swiss francs per calendar year.

## For more comfort in the hospital

###### With Sodalis Flex supplementary hospital insurance, you have a free choice of doctor and hospital within the canton of Valais. In addition, you decide before each stay which ward you would like to be accommodated in: general, semi-private or private. For the accommodation on the semi-private and private department you make an additional payment.

###### If you combine the hospital insurance with the basic insurance and the outpatient supplementary insurance, the Sodalis health insurance company will contribute to your fitness costs. The prerequisite is that you visit a partner fitness centre.

## Family discount from the third child onwards

###### In the compulsory health insurance, Sodalis grants a family discount of 50 percent from the third insured child onwards. Supplementary hospital insurance is free of charge for children if the child is covered by basic health insurance with the health insurance fund, if an outpatient supplementary insurance policy has been taken out and if one parent is also covered by the same hospital insurance policy.
