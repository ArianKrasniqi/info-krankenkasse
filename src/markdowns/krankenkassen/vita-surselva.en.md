## The range of basic insurance products

###### Vita Surselva offers two models of compulsory basic insurance. In the Standard model (free choice of doctor), you are free to choose which doctor you visit in the event of illness. You can contact your family doctor, go to a group practice (HMO) or consult a specialist directly.

###### The family doctor model Sparmed offers the same services as the standard model, but restricts the choice of the first contact person to the family doctor. In return, the health insurance company grants you lucrative discounts. You choose your family doctor from a list of affiliated doctors.

## Save premiums with a higher franchise

###### In addition to the choice of an alternative insurance model, there is also the option of reducing the insurance premium by means of a higher annual deductible. Adults can pay a voluntary deductible of up to 2,500 Swiss francs per year; children can pay an annual deductible of up to 600 Swiss francs. Vita Surselva does not offer a family discount.

## Supplementary insurance with Vita Surselva

###### A voluntary supplementary insurance expands the scope of benefits of the compulsory health insurance. With Vita Surselva, you can take out the supplementary insurance "General supplement" for outpatient treatment. This covers, among other things, preventive measures, visual aids and aids, alternative medicine, non-medical psychotherapeutic treatment, non-compulsory medication and emergency treatment abroad.

## In addition, the Surselva Cumpletta supplementary insurance with partially higher reimbursements is also available.

###### Dental and orthodontic treatments are covered by Denta dental insurance. There are three benefit classes to choose from; the cost coverage is between 50 and 75 percent, with a maximum of 3,000 Swiss francs per calendar year.

## The hospital insurance of Vita Surselva

###### With supplementary hospital insurance, you ensure more comfort and freedom of choice during your stay in hospital. The Surselva Kombi A tariff, for example, offers accommodation in a general ward in a Swiss hospital of your choice.

###### With the Activa product line tariffs, you can insure not only accommodation in a general ward but also a stay in a semi-private or private ward. The Activa switch tariff gives you the flexibility to choose the comfort you want before your stay in hospital.

###### Sanvita hospital insurances are specially designed for non-smokers. The treatment of smoking-related illnesses is not covered, but non-smokers pay lower premiums. In this product line, too, you can choose from the performance classes general, semi-private, private and switch.
