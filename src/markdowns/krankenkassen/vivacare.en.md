## Three basic insurance models

###### Vivacare Krankenkasse offers several models of compulsory health insurance. In the Standard model (free choice of doctor), you decide which doctor you trust. There are also various alternative insurance models to choose from:

### Managed Care: Your first point of contact is your family doctor or a group practice (HMO).

### Med Direct: In the event of illness, you first contact your family doctor.

### Tel Doc: Before you visit your doctor, you contact the Medi24 telemedical advice centre and receive a binding treatment plan.

### Med Call: You contact the telemedical advice centre, but the treatment plan is non-binding.

### Tel Care: This Telmed tariff is only available in certain cantons.

## This is how you can reduce your health insurance premium

###### The alternative insurance models restrict the choice of the first contact person in the event of illness, but you also pay up to 16 percent lower premiums. Health insurance also grants discounts if you increase your annual deductible. Adults can voluntarily pay a franchise of up to 2,500 Swiss francs per year; for children the maximum annual franchise is 600 francs.

## Supplementary insurance from Vivacare

###### With a voluntary supplementary insurance, you receive benefits that go beyond the statutory insurance cover. With Vivacare, you can opt for the following additional models:

### Out-patient: reimburses additional medication, transport costs and maternity benefits. Also includes Vacanza travel insurance.

### Complementary: replaces around 50 forms of treatment in the field of alternative medicine.

### Dental insurance: reimburses the costs of dental treatment, check-ups, dental hygiene and orthodontics in eight benefit levels. The maximum reimbursement is 75 percent, up to CHF 1,800 per calendar year.
