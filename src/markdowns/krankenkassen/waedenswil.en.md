## The basic insurance of Wädenswil health insurance

###### Wädenswil health insurance offers compulsory basic health insurance in two variants. In the Standard model (free choice of doctor), you decide which doctor to consult in the event of illness: Family doctor, group practice (HMO) or a specialist.

###### Alternatively, you can choose the family doctor model. The benefits of both tariffs are the same, but in the alternative insurance model, your family doctor is the first point of contact for all health questions. Your family doctor will coordinate the treatment and refer you to a specialist or hospital if necessary. The general practitioner model is available in the cantons of Aargau, Schwyz and Zurich. Your health insurance company will provide you with a list of general practitioners for you to choose from.

###### A Telmed model is not available.

## Lower premiums due to higher franchise

###### If you choose the family doctor model, you will receive premium discounts. Health insurance will also grant you discounts if you have your franchise increased. The regular annual franchise for adults is CHF 300; you can choose franchises of up to CHF 2,500 per year. For children, the maximum franchise is CHF 600 per year. Wädenswil does not offer any additional family discounts.

## Supplementary insurance for a plus in benefits

###### The contributions of the basic insurance to services such as prevention, alternative medicine or aids are limited. These gaps can be closed with voluntary supplementary insurance.
